# 🔐 Day 5: Password Generator
 
Today’s project is a **Password Generator** built in Python using `for` loops and the `random` module. 
This app allows the user to create custom passwords based on the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

## Also I have attached the python file where the code is short and string module is used in it.

## 🧠 What it does
The Password Generator:
- Takes user input for desired password composition.
- Randomly generates letters, symbols, and numbers.
- **Easy Level**: Creates password in fixed order (letters → symbols → numbers).
- **Hard Level**: Randomizes the final order of all characters for better security.

## 🧰 Concepts Used
- Python 3
- `random` module
- `for` loops
- String operations

## What I learned?
- Using for loops for repetition
- How random.choice() and random.shuffle() work
- The importance of unpredictability in secure passwords
- 
## 🚀 Features
- User-defined number of characters.
- Two modes: Easy (ordered) and Hard (shuffled).
- Secure use of `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()`.
- Clear, beginner-friendly structure using `for` loops.
