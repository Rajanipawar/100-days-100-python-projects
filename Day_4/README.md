# Day 4 - 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game

 ## 🧠 What it does -
This is a simple terminal-based Rock Paper Scissors game built using Python. 
It takes the user's choice, generates the computer's choice using the `random` module, and determines the winner using conditional logic.

## 📚 Concepts Covered
This project demonstrates key Python programming concepts:
- ✅ Variables and Data Types
- ✅ User Input and Output (`input()`, `print()`)
- ✅ Conditional Statements (`if/elif/else`)
- ✅ Random Module
  
## 📚 What I learned
- Handling user input and type conversion
- Generating random values
- Using conditionals to compare logic
- Adding ASCII art for user-friendly CLI UI
- Basic input validation
