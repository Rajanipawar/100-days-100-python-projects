# Day 13: BMI Calculator 🧮
Part of my #100DaysOfPython challenge.
This simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator takes the user's weight and height as input and calculates their BMI. 
It also classifies them into categories: Underweight, Normal weight, or Overweight.

## 🔧 Features:
- Accepts user input for weight (kg) and height (m)
- Calculates BMI using the formula: `weight / (height ** 2)`
- Classifies health based on BMI value
- Rounded output for readability

## 🧠 Concepts Used:
- `input()` and `float()` conversion
- Mathematical operations
- `if-elif-else` conditional logic
- String formatting

## 📁 Files:
BMI_calculator.py – Main Python script to generate messages 
README.md – Project overview and explanation

## 🚀 How to Run:
Make sure Python is installed on your system.
Clone this repository or download the script.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the file using: python tip_calculator.py
