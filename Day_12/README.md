# 🎓 Day 12 – Student Grade Manager

Welcome to Day 12 of my **#100DaysOfPython** challenge!  
Today’s project is a **Student Grade Manager** that uses **list comprehension** to assign grades, and categorize students as passing or failing.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts student scores from the user
- Assigns grades (A, B, C, D, F) based on score
- Identifies passing and failing students
- Clean logic using `list comprehension`
- Efficient result display using `enumerate()` and `zip()`

## 📌 Python Concepts Used

- `input()` and string manipulation
- `list comprehension`
- Conditional logic
- `zip()` and `enumerate()` for output formatting

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Takes a comma-separated list of student scores as input
2. Uses list comprehension to:
   - Assign letter grades
   - Separate passing and failing scores
3. Prints a clear grade report for each student
4. Shows a summary of passing vs failing students
