# 🍕 Day 3 – Pizza Order Delivery Project

## 🧠 What it does:
A fun and interactive console-based program that simulates a pizza ordering system.  
The user:
- Selects the pizza size (S, M, L)
- Decides whether to add pepperoni
- Chooses if they want extra cheese  
Based on the inputs, the program calculates and displays the final bill.

## 🛠 Built With:
- Python 3
- `input()` for user interaction
- `if`, `elif`, `else` conditional statements
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Formatted strings with `f-strings`

## 📚 What I learned
- How to use conditional logic effectively
- Nested decision-making in Python
- User input validation and program flow
- Creating a simple yet realistic billing system
