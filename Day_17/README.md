## 📌 Day 18 – Number Guessing Game 🎯

This project is a Number Guessing Game built with Python.
The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number within a limited number of attempts. 
Players can choose a difficulty level:
🟢 Easy: 10 attempts
🔴 Hard: 5 attempts
The program provides feedback ("Too high" or "Too low") after each guess and tracks remaining attempts.

## 📚 Concepts Practiced
Random number generation
Game logic using loops
Function-based modular programming
Nested conditions and user interaction

## 🌟 What I Learned
This game strengthened my understanding of:
Structuring games using logic and state
Reusability through functions
Input validation and user experience

## 🛠️ What I Used
random.randint()
Conditional statements (if, else)
Loops (while)
Functions for modular logic
User input handling

## 🚀 How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed.
Clone the repo or copy the code.
Run the script using:
python number_guessing_game.py

## 📸 Output Preview
********** Welcome to the Guessing Game! **********
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': easy
You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 50
Too high.
Guess again.
