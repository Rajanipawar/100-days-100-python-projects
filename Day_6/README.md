# Day 6 - Countdown Timer ⏳

This project is a simple countdown timer built using Python’s `while` loop and `time` module.

## 📌 What it does
The script prompts the user to enter a starting number and then counts down to 0, pausing 1 second between each number.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- `while` loop
- time module
- `time.sleep()` function
- Basic input validation
- Countdown logic

## 🚀 How it works

1. Takes a number input from the user to start the countdown.
2. Validates that the number is positive.
3. Uses a `while` loop to print each number with a 1-second delay.
4. Prints a final message when countdown completes.
