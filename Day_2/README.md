# 💡 Day 2: Tip Calculator 🧮

A simple Python script that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip. 

## 🛠 Built With:
- Python 3 🐍
- `input()`, `float()`, `int()`, and basic math
- `round()` function and `.2f` formatting for clean output

## 🧠 What it does:
- Asks the user for:
  - Total bill amount
  - Tip percentage they wish to give (e.g., 10, 12, or 15)
  - Number of people splitting the bill
- Calculates the total amount with tip
- Splits the amount equally among people
- Outputs the exact amount each person should pay

## 📚 What I Learned:
- Type conversion with `float()` and `int()`
- Formatting decimals for currency display using `.2f`
- How to apply math and logic to real-life problems
- Writing clear and readable code
