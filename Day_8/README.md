# Day 8 - 🔐 Caesar Cipher 

A simple Caesar Cipher Encoder & Decoder built in Python using basic functions, loops, and string manipulation!

## 💡 What is a Caesar Cipher?

A Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known encryption techniques where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- for loops
- if-else conditions
- functions
- modulus (%) for wrapping around the alphabet
- while loop for program repetition

## 🛠️ Features

- Encrypt (`encode`) or decrypt (`decode`) any message
- Handles spaces, punctuation, and non-alphabet characters
- User can try again in a single run
- Clean loop & function-based design


## 📸 Preview

Type 'encode' to encrypt and 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello world!
Type the shift number:
5
Here is the encoded result: mjqqt btwqi!
